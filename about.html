            <h1>Hi!</h1>
            <p>I'm Neil Koreman.</p>
            <br>
            <p>I was born in Brooklyn, New York.  After attending the Yeshiva of Flatbush through middle school, I went to Poly Prep Country Day School for high school where I was a member of the Varsity swim, tennis and soccer teams.  I then attended Dartmouth College and majored in Philosophy while pursuing a pre-med course load. At university, I enrolled in three art courses with labs and it was in these art labs when I discovered my interest and talent for painting and drawing.</p>
            <br>
            <p>After graduating from Dartmouth, I returned to Brooklyn to attend Downstate Medical School and, in my first year Anatomy course, met my future wife, Dorothy Goldstein.  We were married in August, 1964 and in order to fulfill his military obligation during the Vietnam War, I elected to join the U.S. Public Health Service.  My wife and I were sent to Detroit, MI where I was stationed.</p>
            <br>
            <p>I completed a residency in Ophthalmology and after a fellowship in Miami, Florida, Dorothy and I decided to move from Detroit to the Sunshine State.  We settled in Miami Lakes, where we opened a joint practice and raised our two children.  After practicing Ophthalmology for 30 years, I retired and turned to golf and painting. I am excited to share my work with you today!</p>
